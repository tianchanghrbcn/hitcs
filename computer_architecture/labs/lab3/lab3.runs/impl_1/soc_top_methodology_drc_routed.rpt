2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock pll/inst/clk_in is defined downstream of clock sys_clk and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks sys_clk and clk_out_clk_pll are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks sys_clk] -to [get_clocks clk_out_clk_pll]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks sys_clk and clk_out_clk_pll are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks sys_clk] -to [get_clocks clk_out_clk_pll]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock pll/inst/clk_in is created on an inappropriate internal pin pll/inst/clk_in. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-5#1 Warning
Mapped onto distributed RAM because of timing constraints  
The instance mrcore/inst/BranchPredictor_module/global_BPB0_reg_0_127_0_0 is implemented as distributed LUT RAM for the following reason: The timing constraints suggest that the chosen mapping will yield a better timing.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-5#2 Warning
Mapped onto distributed RAM because of timing constraints  
The instance mrcore/inst/BranchPredictor_module/global_BPB0_reg_128_255_0_0 is implemented as distributed LUT RAM for the following reason: The timing constraints suggest that the chosen mapping will yield a better timing.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-5#3 Warning
Mapped onto distributed RAM because of timing constraints  
The instance mrcore/inst/BranchPredictor_module/global_BPB1_1_reg_0_127_0_0 is implemented as distributed LUT RAM for the following reason: The timing constraints suggest that the chosen mapping will yield a better timing.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-5#4 Warning
Mapped onto distributed RAM because of timing constraints  
The instance mrcore/inst/BranchPredictor_module/global_BPB1_1_reg_128_255_0_0 is implemented as distributed LUT RAM for the following reason: The timing constraints suggest that the chosen mapping will yield a better timing.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-5#5 Warning
Mapped onto distributed RAM because of timing constraints  
The instance mrcore/inst/BranchPredictor_module/global_BPB1_reg_r1_0_127_0_0 is implemented as distributed LUT RAM for the following reason: The timing constraints suggest that the chosen mapping will yield a better timing.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-5#6 Warning
Mapped onto distributed RAM because of timing constraints

Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-5#7 Warning
Mapped onto distributed RAM because of timing constraints  
The instance mrcore/inst/BranchPredictor_module/global_BPB1_reg_r2_0_127_0_0 is implemented as distributed LUT RAM for the following reason: The timing constraints suggest that the chosen mapping will yield a better timing.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-5#8 Warning
Mapped onto distributed RAM because of timing constraints  
The instance mrcore/inst/BranchPredictor_module/global_BPB1_reg_r2_128_255_0_0 is implemented as distributed LUT RAM for the following reason: The timing constraints suggest that the chosen mapping will yield a better timing.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#1 Warning
Timing of a block RAM might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance mrcore/inst/FU_MU_module/dcache_tag0_reg, implemented as a block RAM, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#2 Warning
Timing of a block RAM might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance mrcore/inst/FU_MU_module/dcache_tag1_reg, implemented as a block RAM, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#3 Warning
Timing of a block RAM might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance mrcore/inst/FU_MU_module/dcache_tag2_reg, implemented as a block RAM, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-12#1 Warning
DSP input not registered
